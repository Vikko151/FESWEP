# FESWEP
A greatly cleaned and optimized fork of FE gun kit that can be scripted like Garry's Mod SWEPs.

The goal of this fork is to allow greater performances and control over weapons, making @thienbao2109's weapon kit all purpose and cleaner for deeper uses.

# Main additions:

- A new, Garry's Mod like, way to make weapons: everything can be done without headache whenever it's about making an extremely deadly sword, a building tool, or even a teddy bear.
- Support for declarative and imperative UI: we give you the informations and you manage your UI like you want.
- An objectively more optimized code: you simply put what you need inside the code without functions that have to support every settings.
- Way-to-go NPC support: your weapon's behaviour can be read by NPCs and players in ease.
- Code kept as safe as previously: despite the main code's Module nature, what's shared by the module is mainly read-only

# What's planned:

- A recompiler: configure the settings like in the original kit, the recompiler with make a script from them.
- Gun kit converter: having issues with ACS? It is planned that you'll be in measure to make the move smoothly.

**All rights go to @thienbao2109 and @SuperEvilAzim**, the main developers behind FE gun/weapon kit. If they want to integrate this resource or take it down, they are completely allowed to do so.

**This weapon kit isn't meant for newbies!** This fork has been developed for advanced users who want to go further with FE weapon kit in a way that's cleaner. If you struggle in making your weapons with this kit, this is completely fine. It is easier to start with clear basics than with a blank script like here.
